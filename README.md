In this project I have used Pixabay API to create an image finder application.

It needs an API key that was stored in my .env file.

It shows pictures by your search parametrs and you can select the amount of pictures displayed.

The pictures can be zoomed In and they appear in a dialog window.

Project built on React, Tailwind CSS, Material UI and Axios.
